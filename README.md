## Project Description
The Skill Tokenization Platform is a decentralized application (DApp) that enables users to tokenize their skills as unique digital assets. These skills can be listed for sale, purchased, and transferred securely through the Ethereum blockchain. The platform provides a transparent and immutable ecosystem for skill recognition and monetization.
